# Autobalance
Autobalance is a audio mixing preprocess tool, it has two functions:

## Loudness balance
Autobalance can balance the loudness of different tracks to average by using Monte-carlo algorithm.

## Soundstage seting
Autobalance can set the given tracks/instruments into approprite positions in the soundstage. The algorithm will try to balance the different frequency bands in each position to ensure a smooth auditory effect.

To use Auto balance, just put the script and all tracks in a portfolio and run it.
